# Awesome AI Coding Sandboxes [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of sandboxing and isolation solutions for running the code of autonomous **AI coding agents** (Claude Code, Codex, OpenHands, and friends) — organized **by security posture first**: how strong the isolation boundary is, and what the agent can still reach beyond it.

AI coding agents run arbitrary, model-generated commands. The hard part isn't speed — it's the **security boundary** (isolation) and what the agent can still do through it (**network egress, secrets**), plus **durable workspace state** for long tasks. This list ranks on those, not boot-time benchmarks.

## Comparison matrix

**Isolation tier:** microVM (own kernel) > gVisor (user-space kernel) > container (shared kernel) > process.
**Egress control** = can outbound network be restricted — NOT whether it _has_ network. `deny-default` / `allowlist` / `configurable` / `full-by-default` / `none`.
**Secrets** = `brokered` (creds kept OUT via proxy) vs `env-in` (injected). Sorted by isolation tier, then egress strength.
**Abbrev.:** eph = ephemeral · pers = persistent · Prop. = proprietary.

## What the data shows

**Restricted-by-default egress is the minority.** Deny-by-default: **Cleanroom, smolvm (smol-machines), Leap0, InstaVM, Mitos, ainclave, Baponi**; allowlist-default: **Sprites**. Sixteen offer _configurable_ egress (opt-in), and the rest ship open outbound or delegate/none (Modal, Beam, Northflank, Arrakis, Box, Morph, Tensorlake, Novita, Kubernetes Agent Sandbox, OpenHands). _Isolation is common; egress control is not._

**Secrets brokering (creds kept out of the sandbox)** is now a real cluster: Cleanroom, smolvm, Leap0, InstaVM, Mitos, ainclave, Superserve, Islo, Declaw, Vercel Sandbox, BoxLite, OpenComputer, Blaxel, microsandbox, Runloop, Baponi, OpenSandbox, Cloudflare, Daytona. Env-in: AgentENV, E2B, Modal, Northflank, Beam, Arrakis, SmolVM (Celesto), Qbox, Katakate, Sprites, Morph, Tensorlake, Box, Novita, AIO Sandbox, Kubernetes Agent Sandbox, OpenHands, OmniRun.

**The strong-posture set** (µVM/VM **and** restricted egress **and** brokered secrets) is small: **Cleanroom, smolvm (smol-machines), Leap0, InstaVM, Mitos, ainclave** — plus Superserve/Islo/Declaw/OpenComputer on configurable egress. That's the bar to beat.

**EU data-residency** is offered by three _managed_ entries — **Box (ascii.dev)** (DE/FI/FR), **OmniRun** (Hetzner/DE) and **ainclave** (bare metal, EU). Self-hostable tools (Mitos, Cleanroom, microsandbox, smolvm, …) can additionally be run in the EU _by you_. Still a minority across 38 providers.

**Control-plane reachable from inside** (the "front desk" risk): Sprites documents an in-sandbox management API (reachable); Modal documents it is _not_. Others undocumented.

**Control-plane authentication:** AgentENV currently has no built-in API authorization. Its maintainers explicitly require deployment on a trusted network or behind an authorization proxy.

### How these values were verified

Every cell traces back to the project's own documentation or source repository — not to blog posts, not to vendor comparisons, not to an earlier revision of this list. Where a project documents nothing, the cell says `?` rather than a guess: an honest gap is more useful than a confident error. Contributors quote the supporting phrase in the pull request so a reviewer can check the claim without repeating the research, and the matrix is the single source for [`_data/sandboxes.json`](https://github.com/fhiltscher/awesome-ai-coding-sandboxes/blob/main/_data/sandboxes.json), which CI regenerates and diffs on every change — the structured data this page publishes cannot silently drift from the table above.

### What this ranking does not measure

It reads documentation, not implementations. A **deny-default** cell means the project _documents_ deny-by-default egress; it is not the result of a penetration test, and no escape research was done for this list. Cold-start latency, throughput, pricing, SDK ergonomics and language coverage are deliberately absent — they are covered well elsewhere, and they are not what fails when an agent gets prompt-injected.

A strong row also does not equal a safe deployment. Brokered secrets still require the broker to be configured; an allowlist is only as tight as its entries; a µVM with a mounted host directory has traded its boundary away. Read the matrix as a shortlist filter, then read the docs of the two or three candidates that survive it.

## Why security-posture-first

Community consensus (HN, Reddit, the security literature) is blunt: **containers are not a trust boundary** for untrusted agent code, and **isolation alone "solves the easiest problem"** — the real risk is an agent with legitimate access exfiltrating data via network egress or leaked credentials (prompt injection). So we rank on the boundary _and_ what crosses it, not on cold-start milliseconds (which matter only for ephemeral/high-concurrency workloads, not long-running coding agents).

Key nuance: almost every sandbox _has_ outbound network — that's the problem, not a feature. The differentiator is whether egress can be **default-denied and allowlisted**, and whether **secrets are brokered so the sandbox never holds them**. A strong microVM with unrestricted network still lets a prompt-injected agent phone home with your code — isolation and egress control are **orthogonal**.

- [clawker](https://github.com/schmitthub/clawker) - Self-hosted Docker sandboxes for coding agents, running behind an egress filter.

## Process & namespace sandboxes

Syscall/filesystem/network restriction for individual processes, built on Bubblewrap, Landlock, and seccomp.

## Filesystem & WebAssembly sandboxes

- [AgentFS](https://docs.turso.tech/agentfs) - Copy-on-write filesystem for agents stored in a single SQLite database; the CLI wraps an existing program in a sandboxed session.
- [LocalSandbox](https://github.com/coplane/localsandbox) - Python SDK combining just-bash, AgentFS and Pyodide into a persistent WebAssembly-backed bash/python environment (beta, unaudited).
- [Wassette](https://github.com/microsoft/wassette) - Security-oriented runtime that serves WebAssembly Components as MCP tools.
- [Eryx](https://github.com/eryx-org/eryx) - Runs untrusted CPython on Wasmtime with memory and CPU limits and no filesystem or network access by default.
- [Capsule](https://github.com/capsulerun/capsule) - Runtime that executes agent tasks as untrusted code in isolated WebAssembly environments.
- [AgentVM](https://github.com/deepclause/agentvm) - Node.js library running an Alpine Linux VM compiled to WebAssembly (container2wasm) in a worker thread.
- [amla-sandbox](https://github.com/amlalabs/amla-sandbox) - WebAssembly sandbox for agent code with capability enforcement, a virtual filesystem and no network.

PRs welcome — **and actually reviewed** (as time allows; no bot auto-closing your PR). See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). Maintained by [@fhiltscher](https://github.com/fhiltscher) ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franz-hiltscher/)).

- One project per PR. Every matrix cell needs a **source link** (official docs/repo). Don't know a value? Use `?` — never guess.
- Entries must run agent-generated code with a real isolation boundary; no dead projects, no marketing-only pages. License is not a criterion.
- Spotted stale or wrong data? Open an issue or PR — accuracy is the whole point.
